# Warriors of Aether: handoff

*A Dota 2-style lane battle game by Aljay Leodones. Godot 4.7.2 (Forward+), Blender 5.2 for building models.*

## Status (keep this section current)

**IMPLEMENTED, PARTLY VERIFIED** (2026-10-12, Blood Ranger / trees / tower scale session).

Verified:
* 53 headless mechanics tests pass, 12 of them new: tree regrowth (180 s, waits for a clear 150 radius), planted trees,
  Mini-Axe and Vegan Picker rules, Burst Shot (wave split, damage per arrow, channel length, every interrupt, instant
  items and queued orders), Gale Impact (damage, sideways throw, piercing, stop at the target point, +20% crash
  damage once, trees felled by the arrow and by thrown units), Masterful Archery (bonus, ~30% rate, 0.8 s gap), the
  Blood Ranger ultimate (lifesteal, range, duration), the back leap (300 away, 1 s gap, ~30%, never into cliffs or
  trees) and item lifesteal against creeps.
* Bot duels (12 min, 3 seeds): the bot plays Blood Ranger's whole kit (Gale Impact, Burst Shot, the ultimate).
* Benchmark (1080p, `--bench=50 --t=240 --autoplay`, RTX 4060): 76 fps average, p95 16.67 ms, p99 24.0 ms. The
  previous measurement was 68-73 fps with p95 16.7-20.9 ms, so no regression.
* Rendered captures of every new feature in `work/shots/br_*`.

Not met:
* Blind review (`work/lemondev/ledger.md`):
  * Burst Shot VFX vs a Dota 2 spell frame: 2 passes REJECTED on the same defect, **STOPPED: PLATEAU**. The critics
    see a flat ground mark and numbers with no visible physical effect on the units hit.
  * Tower scale: **UNVERIFIED**. The benchmark frame turned out to show no lane tower, so nothing was compared.
* Tree, Gale Impact and back-leap visuals were checked in captures only (no independent review).
* Earlier results still stand: Dark Stomp VFX STOPPED: LIMIT, Hero Select STOPPED: PLATEAU, lane scene STOPPED:
  PLATEAU.

## Run it

```
"C:\Users\Lemon PC\Desktop\Godot.exe" --path A:\Python\woa
```
or open `A:\Python\woa\project.godot` in the editor and press F5.

* Or run the exported build: `build/WarriorsOfAether.exe` (rebuild it with
  `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Windows Desktop" build/WarriorsOfAether.exe`).
* The game opens on **Hero Select** (`src/ui/hero_select.tscn`): pick Blood Ranger or Ezee, pick the bot's hero (or
  Random), change your hero's look with **Customize look** (the Hero Creator), then **Play** against Bot Gerald.
* Exported builds ignore scene paths on the command line: `build/WarriorsOfAether.exe -- --match [capture flags]` jumps straight into a match (for automation; `--match` must come after `--`).
* Tests (headless, about 1 minute): `godot --headless --path . -s tests/run_tests.gd`. Add `-- --only=<name>` for a subset. 53 tests.
* Benchmark: `godot --path . res://src/game/main.tscn -- --bench=60 --t=240 --autoplay` writes `work/bench.txt`. Last measured 2026-10-12 at 1080p on the RTX 4060 with the HUD (`--bench=50`): 76 fps average, p95 16.67 ms.
* Screenshot capture (renders, saves, quits): `godot --path . res://src/game/main.tscn -- --capture=work/shots/x.png --t=95 --cam=-1500,-1300 [--autoplay] [--zoom=1.1]`. `--autoplay` lets a bot drive your hero too.
  * `--hero=ezee --bot_hero=galewarden` pick the heroes; `--frames=30,34,38` saves several frames;
    `--live` keeps the simulation running while capturing.
  * Demo staging: `--lvl=18` levels your hero and learns its kit; `--at=wave,170 | tree | hero,520` places it beside
    the enemy wave, between a creep and a tree, or beside the enemy hero (`--weaken=0.12`); `--cast=dark_stomp@4`
    (or `attack`) issues it at capture frame 4. `--board` shows the scoreboard, `--endscreen` the end screen,
    `--drag=x,y,w,h` a selection box, `--marker=x,y` a move marker.
* Bot duels: `godot --headless --path . -s tests/tools/bot_duel.gd -- --a=galewarden --b=ezee --min=12`.
* Parse-check every script: `sh tools/check.sh`.
* Rebuild the building models: `"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 5.2/blender.exe" -b --factory-startup --python tools/blender/buildings.py`.
* Re-bake the terrain texture arrays (needs the GPU, not headless): `godot --path . -s tests/tools/bake_terrain_arrays.gd`.

## Controls (Dota defaults)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Left click / left drag | Select. A drag draws a green box: your own units inside it are selected (hero first); with none of yours inside, the one unit nearest the box centre |
| Right click | Move, attack an enemy, deny an ally below 50% HP, follow an ally. Orders go to the selected units you control (hero, courier), as in Dota |
| A, then left click | Attack-move (ground) or attack (unit). On an ally the order is accepted: your hero waits in range and only swings once the ally can be denied. Shows your attack range |
| S | Stop (the hero still auto-attacks enemies in range). Hold S: hard stop, no auto-attack until your next order |
| H | Hold position |
| Shift | Queue the order |
| Q W E R | Abilities. Point and unit abilities show a targeting cursor; right click or Esc cancels |
| Ctrl + Q W E R, or the "+" above an ability | Learn the ability |
| Right click an ability button | Toggle autocast (Frost Quiver) |
| Z X C V B N | Items. Right click an item slot to move it between the inventory and the backpack |
| F4, the Shop button, or B with an empty slot 5 | Shop |
| J, or the button above the minimap | Glyph |
| T | Town Portal: target a point or the minimap; the hero teleports beside the nearest allied building after a 3 s channel |
| F3, or the Courier button | Courier fetches your stash and flies it to you |
| Buyback button (while dead) | Buy back: 200 + net worth / 13 gold, 8 minute cooldown |
| F1 | Select your hero; press twice to centre on it |
| Portrait | Click: select your hero and centre the camera on it. Hold: the camera follows your hero |
| Ctrl + 1..9, then 1..9 | Control groups (double tap centres the camera) |
| Alt + click | Ping (ground or minimap) |
| Tab (hold) | Scoreboard with damage tables |
| Top-bar hero tiles | Click to look at a visible hero; dead heroes show their respawn timer |
| Space (hold) | Follow your hero |
| Screen edges, arrow keys, middle-drag | Pan the camera |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom |
| Minimap | Left click or drag moves the camera; right click moves your hero |

## The customisable hero (your request: "very very customisable and dressable")

`HeroAppearance` drives `assets/characters/hero/hero.glb`, the body you supplied in beyond-heroes. It has 132 animations, including the full bow set and female locomotion.

* **Look** (`HeroLook`):
  * 20 shape keys: the female figure, muscle, belly, build, rear, and 15 face shapes.
  * Height, head, hands and feet size.
  * Skin, eye, lip, brow and marking colours, plus 12 skin patterns, 10 eye styles, 7 brow styles and 8 markings.
  * 16 hair styles and 8 beards, each with a length slider.
  * 13 presets (Huntress, Shieldmaiden, Moon Elf, Goblin King and more).
* **Outfit**: 143 worn pieces in 10 slots (inner garment, armor, leggings, helm, gloves, boots, 4 accessories), listed in `assets/characters/hero/wear/catalog.json`. Every piece follows the body sliders, the female shape included. Each slot can be dyed (cloth, trim, leather, metal, gold).
* Heroes are set up in `main.gd` `_spawn_heroes()`. A hero creator screen is the next UI step (see the backlog below).

## Assets and licences

See `docs/ASSET_CREDITS.md`.

## Blood Ranger (replaced Galewarden on 2026-10-12)

Ranged agility hero (Galewarden's base stats), crimson-haired huntress. Your numbers are used as given; level 1
takes the base value ("55% + 10% per level" = 55/65/75/85%). Numbers you did not give are marked *chosen*:

* **Burst Shot (Q)**: point target, cast range 900 *chosen*, area radius 400 *chosen*. Channels 2 s *chosen*: 5 waves
  0.4 s apart, each a random 4-7 arrows, 30 in all. Each arrow hits a random enemy in the area (or the ground) for
  55/65/75/85% of her average attack damage as physical damage (a spell: no lifesteal, no Masterful Archery).
  Ended by move, attack, stop or hold orders, other casts, stuns, silence, roots and pushes. 17 s cooldown, mana
  90-120 *chosen*.
* **Gale Impact (W)**: a great arrow to the target point (300-2000 range), speed 2000 and radius 110 *chosen*,
  pierces. 120/200/280/360 magic damage, then hurls each enemy sideways off the arrow's line (with a little forward
  push). A thrown enemy that hits a cliff, tree, building or unit takes another 20% of the arrow's damage once.
  Trees on the path and trees that thrown units hit are felled. 12 s cooldown, mana 100-130 *chosen*.
* **Masterful Archery (E)**: passive, 30% chance *chosen* per attack to add 8/18/28/38% of her agility as physical
  damage (charged arrow, crimson burst, a red "+N!" number), 0.8 s cooldown (the E icon shows it).
* **Blood Ranger (R)**: 15 s of 40/50/60% lifesteal and +200/300/400 attack range. Each attack that hits her has a 30%
  chance to make her leap 300 back, away from the attacker (stopped short by cliffs, trees and buildings). *Chosen*:
  at most one leap per second, so creep fire cannot chain them; the leap keeps her orders. 30 s cooldown, mana
  100-150 *chosen*.
* Your Masterful Archery wording ("8% + 10 per level agility") had no chance value and could also be read
  differently; at level 4 with 100 agility the burst adds 38 damage. Tell me if you meant something stronger.

## Trees, Mini-Axe and Vegan Picker

Trees are destructible as in Dota (see `docs/MECHANICS.md`, "Trees"): they fall to the Mini-Axe (Quelling Blade),
Vegan Picker (Tango), Gale Impact and thrown units, and grow back after 180 s (current Dota value; it was 5 minutes in
older patches), waiting while a unit stands within 150. Ironwood Twig (Iron Branch) plants a 20 s tree. Regrowth and
planting animate in; eaten trees shrink away; felled trees topple away from the blow.

## Towers

Tower models are 40% smaller (scale 0.6; tier growth kept); the health bar, crystal light and bolt launch point
follow. Their footprint in the simulation is unchanged.

## Ezee, the Dark Paladin (added 2026-10-12)

Melee strength hero (`src/sim/sim_data.gd`, abilities in `src/sim/sim_abilities.gd`). Numbers you did not specify are
marked here so you can change them:

* **Dark Stomp (Q)**: 60/90/120/150 magic damage in 350 radius (damage and radius chosen), then a physics push away
  from Ezee: velocity falls off with distance and mass (creeps 1, heroes 1.2, siege 1.8), units fly in an arc, slide,
  bounce off walls and transfer momentum to units they hit. An enemy that crashes into a unit, tree, cliff or building
  takes 50/75/100/125 impact damage (chosen) and is stunned 0.7 s per level once it stops; a tree it hits is smashed.
  Cooldown 12 s, mana 100-130 (chosen).
* **Leap Strike (W)**: picks the visible enemy within 800 (range chosen) with the lowest health fraction, the nearest
  if none is hurt; nothing happens (no mana or cooldown spent) if no enemy is in sight. Leaps in 0.55 s and deals
  100/125/150/175 + 60% strength pure damage, slowing 40% (amount chosen) for 1.5 s. Cooldown 16/15/14/13 s.
* **Tainted Touch (E)**: lightning enchants the sword for 7 s; attacks add 60/90/120/150 magic damage and curse the
  target for 5 s (revealed to Ezee's team even when invisible, 300 sight radius around it). Cooldown 11 s.
* **Unholy Might (R)**: roar, 0.5 s screen shake, dark aura for 10 s. Each damage instance has a 30/40/50% chance
  (chosen) to be halved, the other half dealt as pure damage to a random enemy within 700 (chosen). Then a 50% slow
  for 2 s. Cooldown 25 s.
* Look: the customisable hero body in full plate (Warden Plate), visored greathelm, violet dyes and a darkened
  greatsword (`GameSettings.default_look("ezee")`). The bot plays Ezee with its own skill and item build.

## Backlog: smallest next actions first

1. Ezee's look on Hero Select: lighter or more reflective armour (the review plateaued on a dark silhouette).
2. Dark Stomp art: hand-painted spike texture with ground mounds; units visibly lifted by the eruption.
3. Performance: find the p95 spikes (p99 about 22-28 ms in both old and new builds).
4. Art pass on buildings:
   * Better Ancient design: floating crystal and rune ring instead of the stick arms.
   * Larger stone blocks on towers.
   * Replace the paving texture, which reads as a checkerboard.
5. Done: Hero Creator, Hero Select, Town Portal, buyback, courier, pause and settings menus, end screen with damage
   table. Still deferred: secret shop, runes, Roshan, scan, wards UI polish.
6. More heroes (the bot plays Blood Ranger and Ezee, mid only).
